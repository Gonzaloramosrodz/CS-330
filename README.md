How do I approach designing software?
This project helped me sharpen my ability to plan scenes from concept to implementation. I developed new design skills in spatial layout, lighting control, and user perspective. I started by sketching a warm, realistic workspace with layered lighting and planned each object's placement for balance and immersion. I followed an iterative design process: drafting, testing, and refining object positions, textures, and lighting. These tactics—like rapid prototyping and scene sketching—can easily apply to future projects, whether for game environments or UI-heavy applications.

How do I approach developing programs?
I adopted a modular development strategy, breaking down the scene into manageable objects like the desk, lamp, plants, and laptop. I used OpenGL primitives and transformations to build each object step by step. Iteration was crucial: I tested lighting effects, camera angles, and texture mappings multiple times, learning through trial and error. Over the milestones, my coding evolved from simple static shapes to a fully interactive scene with camera movement, lighting models, and textured realism. I became more comfortable managing complexity through structured, reusable functions.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
This course introduced me to computational graphics and gave me valuable insight into how visual environments are created from code. These skills can support my future education in areas like game development, simulation, and controls programming. Professionally, learning 3D graphics deepens my ability to model and visualize complex systems—whether it's rendering industrial processes, designing virtual environments, or creating training simulations. It bridges creativity and logic, two essential components in my career as an engineer and future software developer.
